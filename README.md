# beryllium-forge
Minecraft Bedrock Multi Instance Launcher

This application is a tool I once made Inspired by the inofficial Bedrock Launcher and Java's Multi Instance Launcher "curseforge".
I used to use this Project to learn from it and it is by far from finished. I learned new tools and techniques over the time which is why I wanted to remake this project. And as as a result I decided to make my test version public and start over but this time better.

There are many flaws that should be concidered while runing this application:

1.Dev mode needs to be enabled in your windows settings.

2.The Downloaded versions are getting saved in the apps directory and need to be deleted manually.

3.Each version except for the official once are running in Trial mode.

4.bad ui/ux

All rights of assets used inside the application belong to Mojang.
